# This application simulates a command line interface using Python
# Users will be able to input commands and arguments that will then execute actions performed from
# a traditional Task Tracker.
# These actions involve:
#   - Add, Update, Delete tasks
#   - Mark a task as in progress or done
#   - List all tasks
#   - List all tasks that are done
#   - List all tasks that are not done
#   - List all tasks that are in progress
